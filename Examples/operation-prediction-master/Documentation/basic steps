parse_stories , get_stories -- reading the data and converting into the form (story, query, answer)

vectorize_story -- converting the story and query of each qquestion into vectors after apdding them

chunk_question -- removing the query part from the question

find_answer -- applies the predicted operation to the numbers


Steps:
1) Reading of data and changing into story,query,answer
2) Generating a vocabulary of the number of operations and words
3) finding maximum length of the story and the query
4) Creating a word_idx from our vocabulary (giving every word a number)
5) Vectorizing the story and the query
6) passing in the model and getting results :)
