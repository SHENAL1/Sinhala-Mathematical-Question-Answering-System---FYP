## iSolveMath###


**********


**iSolveMath solves and visualizes Math Word Problems (MWPs).**

**Introduction**
=============

iSolveMath is a platform where a student can enter a maths word problem, get an automatic answer and visual explanation generated of both the question and the answer.

**Approach**
========
You can check the system which solves simple arithmetic problems https://github.com/purvanshi/operation-prediction

The system at present solves starightforward simple interest problems like-

- How much time will it take for an amount of $900 to yield $81 as interest at 4.5% per annum of simple interest?
- If Manohar pays an interest of $750 for 2 years on a sum of $4,500, find the rate of interest.
- Sahil took a loan for 6 years at the rate of 5% per annum on Simple Interest, If the total interest paid was $1230, Find the principal.

The process takes place as follows-
- Finding the question part and classifying into what is unknown.
- Finding the known quantities with the help of NER tagging and classification of money tag into simple interest, amount or    principal.
- Formula call and return of answer.
Each basic word problem can be classified into subcategories. For example, SI problems can be divided into:
  
  1. Finding a quantity when three others are given. 
  2. Investment of parts (example - splitting investment into two parts, and finding the cumulative interest after a year). This also includes profit sharing.
  

**Current Work and research**
=========================
We have worked on the arithmetic word problem solver http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/I17-3017
The code at present is highly domain specific. To make it more generic, we would be using deep learning and semantic graph formation technique to solve a wide variety of problems.

Demo and working - Siddharth Khanooja, Himanshi Mehta

**Who can contribute**
==================
- Researchers - People who want to challenge the current accuracies of present maths word problem solvers, or extend the research in this field to higher level and complex problems and who love to play with the language(natural language processing).

- Developers - We beleieve in building something which can be used by someone directly. Bridging the gap between research and develepment work, iSolveMath is a platform which involves both development and research work.

- _ANYONE WHO LOVES MATHS AND BELIEVES EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD LOVE IT TOO._


**Alternatives currently available in maths word problem solving**
==============================================================

The following alternatives already exist, but they perform to a limited capacity:


- `WolframAlpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`_ (as detailed here - `[1] <https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/MathematicalWordProblems.html>`_, and `[2] <http://blog.wolframalpha.com/2012/10/04/solving-word-problems-with-wolframalpha/>`_ ): WolframAlpha has been *the* computational engine ever since its inception in 2009. This means that it would return answers to factual answers directly, rather than linking to pages that *might* contain the content. WolframAlpha began offering solutions to single-step junior-school level problems in 2012, and has been refining it till now.

  The only problem with using WolframAlpha as a natural language parser (rather than a computational engine) is the maximum *complexity* of the word problems that the site can handle, which is depressingly low. 

- `Euclid <http://euclid.allenai.org/>`_: Euclid is one of the products of the Allen Institute of Artificial Intelligence (AI2),  It aims to solve SAT-style Math questions. (for example, "What is x, if x plus three is 10?"
