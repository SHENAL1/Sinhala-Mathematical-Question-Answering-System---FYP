# Sinhala Plagiarism Checker

We experimented comparing n-grams for identifying related news reports to a given news because two related news reports mostly use same vocabulary and word n-grams in the content. We used unigram, bigram and trigram features with Cosine and Jaccard similarity. Pre-processing steps such as filtering Sinhala words, stemming, stop word removal were applied before generating word n-grams and calculating the similarity between documents.
